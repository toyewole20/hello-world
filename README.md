# hello-world
This is me checking how to use the github website to create a personal repository
## Write about myself? Well, my background is in chemical engineering, and after taking SQL classes in my graduate program, i'm a few python courses away from having a computer science degree. I will be learning how to build models for predictive analysis and more more staistical analysis using python. I'm pretty gassed up, hope I enjoy this

# Thats all :D
