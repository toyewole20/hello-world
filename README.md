# hello-world
Roses are red, the sky is blue, what next? 
## Write about myself? Well, my background is in chemical engineering, and after taking SQL classes in my graduate program, i'm a few python courses away from having a computer science degree. I will be learning how to build models for predictive analysis and more statistical analysis using python. I'm pretty gassed up, hope I enjoy this

# Thats all :D
